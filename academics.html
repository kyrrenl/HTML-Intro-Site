            I graduated from Leadership Academy for Young Men in 2016, my first year of college was spent at Monroe Community College and now I am a junior at R.I.T for Computing and Information Technologies. My road to RIT has been up and down. At first, I had no intentions on attending because I was in Business Administration at the time and planned to pick a cheaper school. After spending my senior year in high school working an internship in the I.T department at Rochester General Hospital, I realized that I found a new interest and had a change of mind, so I applied to the best school locally for a computing major and I do not regret my decision.</p>
